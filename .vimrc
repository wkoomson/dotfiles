" Welcome to Vim (http://go/vim).

" If you see this file, your homedir was just created on this workstation.
" That means either you are new to Google (in that case, welcome!) or you
" got yourself a faster machine.
" Either way, the main goal of this configuration is to help you be more
" productive; if you have ideas, praise or complaints, direct them to
" vi-users@google.com (http://g/vi-users). We'd especially like to hear from you
" if you can think of ways to make this configuration better for the next
" Noogler.
" If you want to learn more about Vim at Google, see http://go/vimintro.

" Enable modern Vim features not compatible with Vi spec.

" Plugin configuration.
" See http://google3/devtools/editors/vim/examples/ for example configurations
" and http://go/vim/plugins for more information about vim plugins at Google.

" Plugin loading is commented out below - uncomment the plugins you'd like to
" load.

" Load google's formatting plugins (http://go/vim/plugins/codefmt-google).
" The default mapping is \= (or <leader>= if g:mapleader has a custom value),
" with
" - \== formatting the current line or selected lines in visual mode
"   (:FormatLines).
" - \=b formatting the full buffer (:FormatCode).
"
" To bind :FormatLines to the same key in insert and normal mode, add:
"   noremap <C-K> :FormatLines<CR>
"   inoremap <C-K> <C-O>:FormatLines<CR>

" Enable autoformatting on save for the languages at Google that enforce
" formatting, and for which all checked-in code is already conforming (thus,
" autoformatting will never change unrelated lines in a file).
" Note formatting changed lines only isn't supported yet

" Enable file type based indent configuration and syntax highlighting.
" Note that when code is pasted via the terminal, vim by default does not detect
" that the code is pasted (as opposed to when using vim's paste mappings), which
" leads to incorrect indentation when indent mode is on.
" To work around this, use ":set paste" / ":set nopaste" to toggle paste mode.
" You can also use a plugin to:
" - enter insert mode with paste (https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired)
" - auto-detect pasting (https://github.com/ConradIrwin/vim-bracketed-paste)
